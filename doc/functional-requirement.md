## extended functional requirements
- initialize standard 8*8 chess board
- rows and cols should have marks on them on both vertical and horizontal
- the game only ends if king piece of either black or white is captured, 
- white goes first then black, then alternate between them
- after a piece moved, print out the state of the board including whose turn currently is
- provide an input to print out current board state including whose turn currently is
- a piece is moved by choosing its coordinate on the board and the coordinate where the player want to move it
- pawn is the only piece whose capture movement is different from regular movement
- pawn can only capture forward
- pawn can move 2 cells forward on its first move
- the pieces that can be moved depends on whose turn currently is, e.g. if it's currently black's turn then 
only black pieces can be moved, vice versa for white
- check and checkmate is not required
- expect for knight, when moving the piece
  - there's a friendly piece on the way then cannot move to and beyond that
  - there's an enemy piece on the destination coordinate then must capture that enemy piece
  - there's an enemy piece on the way then cannot move beyond that enemy piece
- no take-backs, undo, or reset, a movement is final
- coordinate format is "[a-zA-Z][1-8]", e.g. "a1", "G7"
- to know whether there's a piece between selected coordinate and destination coordinate must know which [movement](./low-level-design.md#movement) is it doing then use that movement to trace coordinates from selected to destination coordinate
